# Snake_JS

-- A Snake-Game for 4 Players

-- Made for a gaming table

__Important:__ Don't change highscore_snake.txt! Make sure the application process has rights to write this file!

This Applikation needs the old KIJS-Framework to run! // Send me a mail for further information :-)

__~Note:~__ I use this application on a raspberry pi 3 (with chromium in kiosk mode). I wrote a script with python to interpret gpio signals (I use joysticks) and send out key strokes. It works flawlessly as such. However, sometimes the snakes don't react or only react when the joysticks are moved repeatedly. Any help to solve this problem is highly appreciated!
