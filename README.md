-- A snake game for 4 players! Eat cherries and avoid obstacles and other snakes!

-- Made for a gaming table

__Important:__ Don't change highscore_snake.txt! Make sure the application process has rights to write this file!

This application requires the old KIJS framework to run! // Send me a mail for further information :-)


__Modes:__<br />
_Normal:_ 1 snake, controlled with arrow keys<br />
_Table:_ 1 - 4 snakes, controlled with joysticks or button (for more information, please send me a mail)<br />
_Magic Mode:_ useable in normal and table mode. An automatic snake appeares! It can replace obstacles! Kill it or it kills you!

__Snakes:__<br />
If you use "snake.js" and "magicsnake.js" the snakes are build up with circles. This looks rather spectacularly (from my point of view at least). However tho paint these snakes, various for-loops are needed which tends to decrease fps significantly once the sankes grew large.<br />
With "snake2.js" and "magicsnake2.js" the snakes are build up with circles and rectangles. This doesn't look as spectacularly. However the performance is much better due to less loops and less elements.
