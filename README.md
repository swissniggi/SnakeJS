# Snake_JS

-- A snake game for 4 players! Eat cherries and avoid obstacles and other snakes!

-- Made for a gaming table

 __Important:__ Don't change highscore_snake.txt! Make sure the application process has rights to write this file!

This application requires the old KIJS framework to run! // Send me a mail for further information :-)


__Modes:__<br />
_Normal:_ 1 snake, controlled with arrow keys<br />
_Table:_ 1 - 4 snakes, controlled with joysticks or button (for more information, please send me a mail)<br />

For additional fun, add up to four cpu-controlled snakes!!

_(the original snake (build up gtom circles) is no longer compatible with the rest of the game. Therefore all relating code has been deleted)_
